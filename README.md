## About

The Hero's Journey is literally that. People can't fly or phase thru walls but people can inspire others, can save others, and can significantly improve the lives of others. This is my way of becoming a hero -- so I am doing my best to become an amazing developer who can show a bright future to those who are currently growing up in difficult situations.
